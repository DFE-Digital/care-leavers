The website aims to provide clear guidance on EET options, considering the complexities of housing and independent living.</li> <li>Rights and Entitlements: A significant number of care leavers are unaware of their rights and the support available to them, which can be a barrier to accessing EET opportunities. The website intends to provide clear, accurate, and accessible information to help care leavers understand and exercise their entitlements.</li> <li>Access to Housing and Support: Stable housing and financial security are crucial for care leavers to pursue EET opportunities. The platform aims to connect users with relevant resources to mitigate challenges related to accommodation and financial instability.</li> <li>Inconsistent Support: The level of support from local authorities can vary, leading to gaps in assistance for care leavers. The website strives to serve as a consistent and reliable source of information, bridging these gaps and providing timely support.</li> <li>Instability in Pathways: Care leavers often experience disrupted educational and employment pathways due to instability in their lives. The platform aims to offer tailored guidance to help users navigate and re-engage with EET opportunities when they are ready.</li> <li>User-Facing Information, Advice, and Guidance (IAG): While various charities provide support for care leavers, there is a need for a centralized, credible, and up-to-date source of information. The website seeks to complement existing resources by offering comprehensive IAG to empower care leavers in their transition.</li> </ul> <p>By addressing these critical areas, this test plan aims to ensure that the Care Leavers website effectively supports its users, enabling them to navigate their transition to independence with confidence and resilience.</p>"},{"location":"testing/Test-Plan/#testing-objectives","title":"Testing Objectives","text":"<ul> <li>Validate that all functionalities meet the business requirements.</li> <li>Ensure seamless integration between the web application and external systems.</li> <li>Verify the responsiveness and performance of the website.</li> <li>Identify and resolve defects before release.</li> <li>Focus on user-centric testing, prioritizing accessibility and usability.</li> <li>Validate mobile-first design responsiveness.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"testing/Test-Plan/#testing-scope","title":"Testing Scope","text":""},{"location":"testing/Test-Plan/#in-scope","title":"In-Scope:","text":"<ul> <li>Functional Testing: Validating website features, content retrieval from Contentful, and API-driven functionality.</li> <li>UI/UX Testing: Ensuring user-friendly navigation, intuitive content display, and adherence to design guidelines.</li> <li>Mobile Responsiveness: Testing on multiple devices and screen sizes.</li> <li>Download, Save, and Share functionality for documents.</li> <li>Integration Testing:</li> <li>Contentful CMS (data fetching and rendering).</li> <li>Translation Services (Google &amp; Azure Translate API).</li> <li>Redis Cache.</li> <li>API Testing (validation of request/response structure).</li> <li>API Failovers handled gracefully.</li> <li>Performance &amp; Security Testing (basic validation; full-fledged testing may be scheduled later).</li> <li>Browser Compatibility Testing: Ensuring support across:</li> <li>Chrome (latest 2 versions)</li> <li>Edge (latest 2 versions)</li> <li>Firefox (latest version)</li> <li>Safari-webkit</li> <li>iOS (Safari, latest version)</li> <li>Android (Chrome, latest version)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"testing/Test-Plan/#out-of-scope","title":"Out-of-Scope:","text":"<ul> <li>Contentful Infrastructure Testing: The internal architecture and hosting of Contentful CMS are outside the testing scope.
