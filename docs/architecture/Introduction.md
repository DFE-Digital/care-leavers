# Care Leavers

The service aims to bring together and simplify relevant information for young people leaving care, and their intermediaries, to make them aware of, and help them understand the services and support available to them so they can navigate independent life to meet their diverse needs.

## Problem Statement

_“How might we ensure that young people know all the options and support that are available to them across the journey of leaving care (approaching leaving and having left care)”_
